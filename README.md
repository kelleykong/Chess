Chess
=====

State first: the code cannot be referred.

It is a project in my first-year graduate student in Dartmouth College. I have done similar job when I am a undergraduate student with two different poker games. Poker and Chess are both good example for AI. But poker is not a perfect game, which you need to guess the pokers in others' hands. On the opposite, Chess is a perfect game which reduces the difficulties. However, it is still difficult to find a good solution quickly. Try more methods, I just find there are so many algorithms I don't know! If you like this, just try it! I should say that I learn chess by watching my players play together!


Use Minimax Search in Game theory to design AI of Chess and try some optimal algorithms: Alpha-Beta Prunning, Transposition Table, Move reordering. The chess library is from  Bernhard Seybold. Details are in report.
